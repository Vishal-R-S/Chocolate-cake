Step 1 : Start mixing the dry and wet ingredients in separate bowls.
Step 2 : Add the wet mixture to the flour mixture and mix the batter until well combined.
Step 3 : Pour boiling water into the batter and stir until smooth. The batter will be very thin.
Step 4 : Pour the batter into your cake pans and bake the cakes on the middle rack of the oven.
Step 5 : Allow the chocolate cakes to cool completely, and then wrap them really well in plastic wrap and stick each layer in a ziplock freezer bag.
Step 6 : The homemade chocolate frosting will keep well in an air-tight container in the fridge. Remove the frosting from the fridge about an hour before youâ€™re ready to frost your cake to allow it to come to room temperature.
Step 7 : Line the bottom of your cake pan, before adding the batter.
